- Built pivot tables to answer business questions:
  - Average discount by category
  - Product rating distribution
  - Total reviews per category
  - Top-rated and most-reviewed products

### 3. Data Visualization
- Designed a dynamic dashboard with:
  - KPI Cards (e.g., Total Reviews, Average Rating, Revenue)
  - Bar & Column Charts (e.g., reviews by category, ratings distribution)
  - Slicers for interactivity by category and rating

## Analysis Tasks & Key Findings:
| S/N | Business Question                                                                 | Approach / Steps Taken                                                                                      | Key Insight / Output                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | What is the average discount percentage by product category?                      | Used an Excel Pivot Table. 'Product Category' was placed in the Rows area, and 'Discount (%)' was placed in the Values area, set to show the 'Average'. | Home Improvements, Computer & Accessories and Health & Personal Care had the highest average discounts                   |
| 2   | How many products are listed under each category?                                 | Used Excel Pivot Table. 'Product Category' was placed in the Rows area, and 'product_name' was placed in the Values area, set to show the 'Count'.  | Distribution varies, with Electronics having the highest number of listings (498) closing followed by Home & Kitchen (448). Whereas Toys & Games, Cars & Motorbikes and Health & Personal Care only had one (1) product listing        |
| 3   | What is the total number of reviews per category?                                 | Used an Excel Pivot Table. 'Product Category' was placed in the Rows area, and 'rating_count' was placed in the Values area, set to show the 'Sum'.   | The total number of reviews per category dramatically highlights customer engagement levels. Electronics absolutely dominates with 14.2M reviews reinforcing its position as the most popular and actively reviewed product category. Categories like Car & Motorbike, Health & Personalcare, and Toys & Games have very low review counts. This indicates very ow consumer engagements or less popular products within this category.   |
| 4   | Which products have the highest average ratings?                                  | Used an Excel Pivot Table. 'product_name' was placed in the Rows area, and 'rating' was placed in the Values area, set to show the 'Average'. The results were then sorted in descending order by 'Average of rating'. | Several products scored 5.0 average rating. This include "Syncwire LTG to USB, Amazon Basics Wireless Mouse and REDTECH USB-C to lighthning. This indicates strong customer satisfaction and positive product experiences for these specific items. Followed closely are the Oratech Coffee Frother Electric and Instant Pot Air Fryer wuth average ratings of 4.8  |
| 5   | What is the average actual vs discounted price by category?                       | Used an Excel Pivot Table with `Average of Actual Price` and `Discounted Price` per Category                              | Electronics show the largest gap between actual and discounted prices, indicating aggressive pricing‚Äîlikely due to high competition or frequent product updates. High discounts on electronics suggest a competitive strategy, likely aimed at clearing stock or attracting price-sensitive buyers. |
| 6   | Which products have the highest number of reviews?                                | Used an Excel Pivot Table. 'product_name' was placed in the Rows area, and 'rating_count' was placed in the Values area, set to show the 'Sum'. The results were then sorted in descending order by 'Sum of rating_count'.   | Amazon Basics High-Speed HDMI leads with 850,000 reviews, followed by boAT Bassheads and Redmi 9A Sport Coral), highlighting their high customer engagement and popularity. These products likely enjoy strong visibility and sustained consumer trust on the platform  |
| 7   | How many products have a discount of 50% or more?                                 | A calculated field or helper column was created to categorize products based on whether their 'Discount (%)' was 50% or more. An Excel Pivot Table was then used to count the number of products that falls in this category  | Nearly 49% of products (662) have discounts of 50% or more, reflecting an aggressive pricing strategy to attract buyers, boost sales, or clear inventory in a competitive e-commerce space.|
| 8   | What is the distribution of product ratings?                                       | Used Pivot Table: Count of products grouped by `Rating` the ratings were furhter grouped in the pivot table using the order 0-1, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5 | Most products are rated between 3.5 and 4.5          |
| 9   | What is the total potential revenue by category?                               | Calculated column: `Actual Price √ó Rating_Count`, then summed using Pivot Table per Category                |  The total potential revenue by category reveals immense market opportunities, particularly dominated by Electronics with an astounding ‚Çπ91,323.9 billion. Other categories, while much smaller in comparison, still represent substantial markets (e.g., "Musicalinstruments" with ‚Çπ151 million, "Officeproducts" with ‚Çπ60 million).  |
| 10   | What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., <‚Çπ200, ‚Çπ200‚Äì‚Çπ500, >‚Çπ500)?   | A calculated column named was calculated 'Price Bucket' was created based on the `Actual Price` to categorize products into '< ‚Çπ200', '‚Çπ200-‚Çπ500', and '> ‚Çπ500'. ` Then, an Excel Pivot Table was used with 'Price Bucket' in the Rows area and 'product_name' was placed in the Values area, set to show the 'Count'. |  The distribution of unique products across price ranges reveals a clear focus on higher-priced items. A dominant majority of products, 850 out of 1351 products fall into the "> ‚Çπ500" price bucket. Products in the "‚Çπ200-‚Çπ500" range are fewer (342 products), and there are very few products in the "< ‚Çπ200" range (only 153 products) |
| 11  | How does the rating relate to the level of discount?                              | First, a calculated field or helper column was created to categorize products into specific discount ranges ('0-10%', '11-20%', '20‚Äì30%', etc). Then, an Excel Pivot Table was used with these 'Discount Range' categories in the Rows area and 'rating' was placed in the Values area, set to show the 'Average'.  | Interestingly, products with the lowest discount range (0-10%, 21-30%) have the highest average rating (4.2). Products with 90-100% discount however had slightly high rating of 4.22. This indicates that high discounts don‚Äôt necessarily lead to higher ratings    |
| 12  | How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews?                                  | An Excel Pivot Table was then used with the 'Ratings Count' in the Rows area and 'product_name' was placed in the Values area, set to show the 'Count'. The 'Ratings Count' were then grouped using the order (0-999 and >1000)| The analysis reveals that 310 products have fewer than 1,000 reviews. These low-review products present an opportunity for targeted marketing, review generation campaigns, or re-evaluation of their product-market fit. |
| 13  | Which categories have products with the highest discounts?                        | Used Pivot Table: Max of `Discount_Percent` by Category                                                      | The analysis showed that Computer & Accessories had the highest discounts (94%) followed closely by electronics and Home & Kitchen with 91% & 90% respectively. This indicates these are highly competitive categories where sellers frequently employ aggressive pricing strategies to attract customers or manage inventory. |
| 14  | Identify top 5 products in terms of rating & number of reviews combined           | A new calculated column named 'Combined Score' was created to evaluate products based on both their 'rating' and 'rating_count'. An Excel Pivot Table was then used with 'product_name' in the Rows area and 'Sum of Combined Score' in the Values area, sorted in descending order to identify the top 5. | The top 5 products that excel in both customer satisfaction (rating) and popularity (review count) are: **Amazon Basic High Speed HDMI**, **boAT Bassheads 100 in**, **Redmi 9A Sports (Coral)**, **Amazon Basics Flexible Premium HDMI** and **JBL C**. **Amazon Basic High Speed HDMI** stands out significantly with the highest combined score, reinforcing its position as a highly popular and well-regarded product. These products are invaluable assets for RetailTech Insights' clients. They represent flagship items that drive sales, build brand reputation, and foster customer loyalty due to their combination of high quality (high rating) high review count. Management should focus on maintaining the success of these products through continued quality assurance, active community engagement, and leveraging their popularity in marketing strategies  |
