## üõ† Tools and Techniques
- ‚úÖ Microsoft Excel (Data Cleaning & Analysis)
- üìå Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts
- ‚úèÔ∏è Calculated Columns (e.g., discount percentage, revenue estimates)
- üìà Interactive Dashboards (with Slicers & Cards)
- üß† Analytical Thinking & Business Insight Generation

## üîç Analytical Approach

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Checked for missing values and inconsistencies
- Ensured correct data types for numerical and text fields
- Created calculated columns:
  - `Discount % = (Actual Price - Discounted Price) / Actual Price * 100`
  - `Potential Revenue = Actual Price * Rating Count`

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Built pivot tables to answer business questions:
  - Average discount by category
  - Product rating distribution
  - Total reviews per category
  - Top-rated and most-reviewed products

### 3. Data Visualization
- Designed a dynamic dashboard with:
  - KPI Cards (e.g., Total Reviews, Average Rating, Revenue)
  - Bar & Column Charts (e.g., reviews by category, ratings distribution)
  - Slicers for interactivity by category and rating
